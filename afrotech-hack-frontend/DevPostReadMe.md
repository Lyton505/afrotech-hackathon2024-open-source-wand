## Inspiration
When applying for internship or jobs, only your past experience is typically considered. Your personal projects may also be considered, but only when they are unique and impactful or creative. Open source contributions are often left out of the mix in all these considerations. We believe this should not be the case because open source contributions are a key indicator of a skilled and collaborative developer. 

Open source projects are the most accessible form of collaborative project-based work, yet 
contributions to open source projects are often neglected. Having seen over 1,000 Black and 
Latinx students contribute to projects like 
[oyster](https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster), we want to see their efforts recognized and rewarded. This is 
where The Open Source Wand comes in: it highlights your technical talent in open source 
development. 

## What it does
The Open Source Wand highlights the strengths of a contributor across five different 
categories:
- **Code Quality**: How well does the contributor write code?
- **Code Style**: How well does the contributor follow well known style guides and style 
  conventions?
- **Code Impact**: How impactful are the contributor’s contributions? How popular is the 
  project they contributed to?
- **Open Source Standards**: How well does the contributor follow open source standards? We 
  specifically look at the contributor’s ability to write good commit messages.
